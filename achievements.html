				<h2>THE STORY</h2>
				<p>We all(founders of Helping hands) were orphans back in the day. We always had to fight for our day-to-day living. We always felt somthing missing in our lives which was support, love, care and affection of a family. As the days passed on we had some help from strangers to build our careers who were wealthy, old and thier children working in different countries, that's when we realised that those love, support, care and affection can be recieved from people who are willing to give them it need not be a family. So we found this orphnage with our savings and have recieved support from many others. The main goal is no matter what there is someone out there who cares for you.</p>
